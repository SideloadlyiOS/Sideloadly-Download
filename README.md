## Sideloadly Frequently Asked Questions & Answers (FAQ)

**Q: How do I set up automatic app refreshing?**  
A: When sideloading your app, you now have an option to automatically refresh it. With automatic refreshing enabled, Sideloadly will automatically enroll the app for automatic refreshing, managed by the Sideloadly Daemon. You will need a computer with Wi-Fi sideloading set up or your device connected via USB. The daemon will attempt to refresh apps near expiry when detected via Wi-Fi or USB.

**Q: How do I enable Wi-Fi sideloading via Sideloadly?**  
A: Ensure your computer and iOS device are on the same network. Connect your device via USB and follow these steps based on your OS:
- **Windows**: Open iTunes > Connected Device > Summary > Options > Enable "Sync with this iDevice over Wi-Fi" > Sync & Done.
- **Latest macOS**: Finder > Select iDevice under 'Locations' > General > Enable "Show this iDevice when on Wi-Fi" > Sync & Done.
- **Older macOS**: Open iTunes > Connected Device > Summary > Options > Enable "Sync with this iDevice over Wi-Fi" > Sync & Done.  
If Sideloadly does not detect your device wirelessly, try opening iTunes and ensure your iDevice screen is on.

**Q: How do I update an app enrolled for automatic refreshing in the daemon?**  
A: Open Sideloadly, add the new IPA using the same Apple/bundle ID, and ensure the automatic refresh option is enabled. Proceed to sideload, and Sideloadly will overwrite the previous IPA and files with the new version.

**Q: How do I enable the Sideloadly Mail Plug-in on macOS?**  
A: Open the macOS Mail App, go to Settings/Preferences, and if needed, log in to an email account with random information to access Mail's preferences. Under General Preferences, click "Manage Plug-ins," enable the SideloadlyPlugin.mailbundle, then click Apply and Restart Mail.

**Q: How long will I be able to use the sideloaded app?**  
A: Free Apple Developer accounts allow apps to function for 7 days. After this, sideload it again with the same Apple ID, ensuring your progress is backed up. Apps signed with a paid Apple Developer Account can last up to 1 year.

**Q: Developer Mode Required. How do I enable developer mode on my iOS device to sideload apps?**  
A: On iOS 16+, enable "Developer Mode" by going to Settings > Privacy & Security > Developer Mode, then switch on the Developer Mode option.

**Q: How can I save or load my in-game progress?**  
A: Ensure your game progress is synced over Game Center, Facebook, Twitter, or Google+. If saving progress locally, install the IPA overwriting the existing one, using the same bundle ID and Apple ID.

**Q: Can I overwrite my current app without removing it?**  
A: Yes, sideload the IPA with the same Apple ID as the previously sideloaded app. If a custom bundle ID was set, use the same ID.

**Q: How many apps can I sideload?**  
A: iOS 7, 8, 9: Sideload as many apps as you like. For iOS 10 and later, you can only have 3 sideloaded apps with a free developer account. A paid Apple Developer Account has no such limitations. For iOS 16.1.2 & lower, you can use WDBRemoveThreeAppLimit to remove this restriction.

**Q: How can I connect Sideloadly to my Apple TV?**  
A: Connect an Apple TV with a USB port to your computer, and Sideloadly will detect it. For portless Apple TVs, sideloading works only on macOS or a virtual macOS on the same network. On macOS, go to Settings > Remotes & Devices > Remote App & Devices to keep it visible for detection.

**Q: Why can't I restore my Game Center game progress after sideloading?**  
A: Apple prevents sideloading apps with the same bundle ID as App Store apps on newer iOS versions. Use a unique bundle ID, which prevents Game Center from recognizing the app.

**Q: Sideloadly does not show my device. How do I fix <no devices detected>?**  
A: Reinstall the web version of iTunes & iCloud, reboot your PC, and ensure your device trusts the PC. Try a different USB cable or port if needed.

**Q: How do I trust the app? How do I fix "Untrusted Developer"?**  
A: Go to Settings -> General -> Profiles/VPN & Device Management, tap on the email used to sideload, and trust it.

**Q: Does Sideloadly support iOS 7 through 16?**  
A: Yes, Sideloadly supports iOS 7 up to iOS 16 and future iOS versions. Report any iOS-specific issues for investigation.

**Q: What kind of .dylibs or .debs can I add to my IPA? App crashes on launch after injecting dylib/deb/framework.**  
A: Sideloadly supports all dylib/deb/framework files, but some designed for Jailbroken devices may crash on non-jailbroken devices. Sideloadly attempts to update these files for non-jailbroken support, though it may not always succeed.

**Q: Where is the Sideloadly auto refresh cache folder located?**  
- **Windows**: `C:\Users\YOURNAME\AppData\Local\cache\sideloadly`
- **macOS**: `/Users/YOURNAME/Library/Caches`

**Q: Does Sideloadly support Apple Silicon M1/M2 Mac?**  
A: Yes, Sideloadly supports Apple Silicon Macs (M1/M2). It will detect and display the Mac on the devices list for IPA installation. Tested on Big Sur, Monterey, and Ventura.

**Q: Does Sideloadly work on Apple Silicon M1/M2 Mac with SIP Enabled?**  
A: Yes, Sideloadly works with SIP enabled. Its functionality with SIP disabled is uncertain.

**Q: Why am I receiving a no permission error when opening my sideloaded M1/M2 iOS App?**  
A: This issue occurs if the IPA was encrypted. Sideload the decrypted version of the IPA to resolve this issue.

**Q: How can I use an app-specific Password?**  
A: App-specific passwords partially work with Sideloadly. They are effective with a paid Apple Developer ID and anisette option disabled.

**Q: Can I make legit In-App Purchases on sideloaded apps?**  
A: No, Apple prevents In-App Purchases on sideloaded/enterprise-installed apps. Install the original App Store version for legit In-App Purchases.

**Q: Which Windows version does Sideloadly support?**  
A: Sideloadly supports Windows 7, 8, 10, and 11. For best results, use Windows 10 or higher.

**Q: Which macOS version does Sideloadly support?**  
A: Sideloadly supports macOS 10.12 Sierra and higher. For best results, use macOS Catalina, Big Sur, Monterey, Ventura, or higher.

**Q: "Sideloadly" wants access to control "System Events"?**  
A: This access is needed for Sideloadly to automatically launch and manage the macOS Mail app during sideloading. You can disallow this access but must manually open the Mail app when launching Sideloadly.

**Q: What information does Sideloadly transmit when connecting to the Anisette server?**  
A: When using "Remote Anisette," the server can see:
- Your IP address
- Your OS (win32, win64, or macOS)
- Sideloadly version  
This data is for debugging purposes and not shared with anyone. Your Apple ID & Password are sent only to Apple servers.

**Q: The app/IPA was sideloaded successfully, but no app or icon is appearing on my home screen?**  
A: Reboot your device; this usually resolves the issue.

**Q: How do I fix "error ‘machineName’"?**  
A: Changing your computer's name might help. Search for “computer name” or “machine name” from the start menu.

**Q: How do I fix "Your maximum App ID limit has been reached. You may create up to 10 App IDs every 7 days."?**  
A: This is an Apple limitation on free developer accounts. Wait a few days or use another Apple ID to sideload.

**Q: How do I fix "This device has reached the maximum number of installed apps using a free developer profile"?**  
A: This is an Apple limitation on free developer accounts, allowing only 3 sideloaded apps at a time. Upgrade to a paid developer account to remove this restriction.

**Q: How do I fix "Your session has expired. Please log in." or "This action could not be completed due to possible environment mismatch."?**  
A: Refer to the tutorial on the Sideloadly subreddit for guidance.

**Q: How do I fix "Call to lockdownd_client_new_with_handshake failed: LOCKDOWN_E_INVALID_HOST_ID" error?**  
A: Ensure you have trusted your PC from your device. Unplug and reconnect the device, and restart iTunes.

**Q: The icon of the sideloaded app is missing?**  
A: This issue may occur with custom icons. Try a different icon or default settings, or restart your device.

**Q: Can I use Sideloadly with a specific set of rules, like a proxy or VPN?**  
A: Sideloadly does not currently support proxy or VPN configurations. Ensure your network allows direct connections to Apple servers.

**Q: What should I do if I encounter a crash or error?**  
A: Check the Sideloadly support forum or GitHub issues page for solutions. Provide detailed error messages and steps to reproduce for better assistance.
